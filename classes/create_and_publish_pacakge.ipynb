    "The \"dumbest\" way to do it is to send a `.py` file to someone by mail. If the receiver has a Python interpreter installed, he can just run the file by writing `python new_file.py` in his command line. This has a few short-comings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The script was written in a specific Python version. You have to make sure that your receiver has the same Python version.\n",
