This repository contains material for the Python for Neuroscience course.
The materials include classes, some assignments and other useful information.
As a student of the course, you should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive
notifications when I update it with new material.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in different repositories,
but the lectures themselves reside here. They're named `classX.ipynb` and are viewable in GitHub,
and editable and runnable with Jupyter Notebook.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in `Resources.md`,
please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found.
